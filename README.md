# Repository of scripts used in the analysis of metagenomic data 

### Evodivmet


This repository contains scripts used to assemble and analyze metagenomic data. While many of the scripts can be run locally, in GNU or OS X, some only work in a cluster with a PBS job scheduler such as Langebio's mazorka. If you want to use those scripts, please check that they are compatible with the job scheduler in your cluster.
